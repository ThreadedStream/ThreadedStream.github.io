title: Why did I start blogging?
---

I love writing, probably even more than reading, and hope that through blogging I'll be able to dedicate myself to all sorts of complex projects and, what's more important, be able to finish them. There's no limit on topics that I'll be writing about, it can be literally anything ranging from programming down to reflections upon a book I happened to read. I also hope that writing will let me generate new ideas, and help me to completely reform my way of approaching problems, be it a reading or programming. Thank you for taking time to read this, that's it for now.
